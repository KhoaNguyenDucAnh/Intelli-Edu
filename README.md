In this study, we addressed the crucial issue of self-learning ability in the Vietnamese education system. Given the evolving landscape, self-learning is increasingly pivotal, especially for high school students transitioning to university. The research aimed to answer the question: "How can software technology enhance the self-learning ability of high school students?" Our team developed and tested software, finding that integrating AI and data analytics significantly improved students' self-learning abilities, as evidenced by enhanced academic performance and increased confidence in self-directed learning.
